          Quark is a fully-featured 2D game engine built as a final project for
          CPSC 4791 at Yale University. It includes an impulse-based physics
          engine, a custom scripting language, and mutex-controlled
          multithreading for subsystems running with different timesteps.

        <div class="description-content">
          Looking back, I should have spent some more time building out useful
          tools to assist in data creation. I had planned on building a scene
          editor early on in the project, but later cut it out because I didn't
          have enough time and decided to focus on my engine. While I am happy
          with how things turned out, having to develop the actual game at the
          end taught me to think from the perspective of the user as well, since
          I realized that some additional tooling would've been more useful as
          opposed to additional features in the engine.

          That being said, if I had more time to work on the project, I would do
          the following, roughly in stated order: build more assistive tooling
          to make scene/collider/rigidbody creation as trivial as possible,
          upgrade my physics engine to include fluid simulations for in-game
          fluid animations, and add nice-to-have features such as spatial sound
          effects, better text rendering, and various performance optimizations.
          At a higher level, I would also like to build an input manager for
          cohesive input tracking and a network manager/networking subsystem
          for multiplayer games.
